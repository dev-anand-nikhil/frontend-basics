            here. We’ll also share why people read and what makes it so important. Now all you have to do is….keep

        <h2>Strengthens Branin activity and Communication Skills</h2>
        <P>Reading gets your mind working across different areas. For starters, it involves comprehension to process the
            words you read. Beyond that, you can use your analytical abilities, stimulate memories, and even broaden
            your imagination by reading words off a page.

            Reading is a neurobiological process that works out your brain muscles. As you do so, you can help to slow
            down cognitive decline and even decrease the rate at which memory fades. Scientists at the University of
            California, Berkeley have even found that reading reduces the level of beta-amyloid, which is a protein in
            the brain that is connected to Alzheimer’s. Who knew that reading could have physical, psychological, and
            spiritual benefits?</P>

        <h2>Makes you Intellectually sound</h2>
        <P>When you read a lot, you undoubtedly learn a lot. The more you read, you can make it to the level of being
            considered “well-read.” This tends to mean that you know a little (or a lot) about a lot. Having a diverse
            set of knowledge will make you a more engaging conversationalist and can empower you to speak to more people
            from different backgrounds and experiences because you can connect based on shared information. Some people
            may argue that “ignorance is bliss,” but the truth is “knowledge is power.” And, the more you read, the more
            you get to know! That’s why you can bet that any educational degree you choose to obtain will involve some
            forms of reading (yes, even math and computer science).</P>
